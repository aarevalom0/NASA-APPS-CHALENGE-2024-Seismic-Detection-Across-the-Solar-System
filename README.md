## GuÃ­a para Usar un Modelo en un Repositorio `.ipynb`


## Guide to Using a Model in a `.ipynb` Repository

To use the model contained in the `.ipynb` file, follow these steps:

### 1. Open the Jupyter Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook in your working environment.
2. Navigate to the location of the `.ipynb` file containing the model.
3. Click on the file to open it.

### 2. Run the Notebook Cells

Once the notebook is open, you can run the cells in the following ways:

- **Run a single cell**: Select the cell you want to execute and press `Shift + Enter`. This will run the current cell and select the next one.
- **Run all cells**: Go to the menu and select `Cell` -> `Run All`. This will execute all cells in the notebook in order, from the first to the last.

### Note

Make sure that all necessary dependencies and libraries are installed before running the notebook. You can refer to the `requirements.txt` file to see which packages are needed and ensure they are installed in your environment.
